# Hello there, I'm Jay! üòÅ

I'm a freshman in college studying Computer Science at [Utah State University][1]. I'm on the fence about what I want to do in computer science, but I have a couple of ideas on what I want to do. I'm passionate about all things programming and always looking to learn something new.

## Programming Languages
I started programming wanting to make a video game, and found out about Python. Which little did I know, would send me down this path. So far I know Python and Java, but I'm hoping and planning to learn more.
