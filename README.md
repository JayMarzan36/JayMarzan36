# Hello there, I'm Jay! üòÅ

I'm a sophomore in college studying Computer Science at Utah State University. I'm on the fence about what I want to do in computer science, but I have a couple of ideas on what I want to do. Maybe cause I'm interested in almost everything, such as data, machine learning / AI, and software development. But I'm always passionate about programming and looking to learn something new every day. 

#### Looking to contact me?
